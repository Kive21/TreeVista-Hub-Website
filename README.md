TreeVista Hub
Welcome to TreeVista Hub, a platform designed to connect tree vendors with buyers while promoting environmental sustainability through the generation of carbon credits. This README file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, the current state of development, and the roadmap for future enhancements.

Project Overview
TreeVista Hub is an innovative marketplace that facilitates the sale of trees by various vendors. Our platform is not only a marketplace but also a part of a broader initiative to combat climate change by enabling the generation of carbon credits through tree planting. The website aims to provide vendors with a convenient way to showcase and sell their trees, while also offering buyers an opportunity to contribute to carbon offset initiatives.

Current Features
Firebase-Based Database and Authentication
Database: TreeVista Hub utilizes Firebase for secure, scalable, and real-time data management. The database stores information about vendors, trees, transactions, and user profiles.

Authentication: User authentication is managed via Firebase Authentication, which provides secure login and registration processes for both vendors and buyers. This ensures that all transactions and interactions on the platform are secure and trustworthy.
